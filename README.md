- Persistent data storage using a relational database and service-oriented architecture.

## Features

- Add, view, update, and delete items and entities.
- Manage inventory and track orders.
- Simulate real-world shopping operations with clean, modular code.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo.
2. Set up the database (SQL schema not included).
3. Run `MenuService.java` as the main class.
